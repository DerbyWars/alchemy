defmodule Alchemy.Cogs do
  alias Alchemy.Cogs.EventRegistry
  alias Alchemy.Events
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides quite a bit of sugar for registering commands.

  To use the macros in this module, it must be `used`. This also defines a
  `__using__` macro for that module, which will then allow these commands
  to be loaded in the main application via `use`

  ## Example Module
  ```elixir
  defmodule Example do
    use Alchemy.Cogs

    Cogs.def ping do
      Cogs.say "pong"
    end

    Cogs.def echo do
      Cogs.say "please give me a word to echo"
    end
    Cogs.def echo(word) do
      Cogs.say word
    end
  end
  ```
  This defines a basic Cog, that can now be loaded into our application via `use`.
  The command created from this module are "!ping", and "!echo",
  ("!" is merely the default prefix, it could be anything from "?", to "SHARKNADO").
  The `ping` command is straight forward, but as you can see, the `echo` command
  takes in an argument. When you define a command, the handler will
  try and get arguments up to the max arity of that command;
  in this case, `echo` has a max arity of one, so the parser will pass up to
  one argument to the function. In the case that the parser can't get enough
  arguments, it will pass a lower amount. We explicitly handle this case
  here, in this case sending a useful error message back.

  ### Shared names across multiple modules
  If I define a command `ping` in module `A`, and a `ping` in module `B`,
  which `ping` should become the command? In general, you should avoid doing
  this, but the module used last will override previously loaded commands
  with a matching name.


  ## Parsing
  The way the parser works is simple: a message is first decomposed into
  parts:
  ```
  prefix <> command <> " " <> rest
  ```
  If the prefix doesn't match, the message is ignored. If it does match,
  a new Task is started to handle this event. This task will try and find
  the function corresponding to the command called, and will return preemptively
  if no such function is found. After that, `rest` is passed to the parser,
  which will try and extract arguments to pass to the function. The default
  parsing method is simply splitting by whitespace. Thankfully,
  you can define a custom parser for a command via `Cogs.set_parser/2`. This
  parser will act upong `rest`, and parse out the relevant arguments.

  ## The `message` argument
  When you define a function with `Cogs.def` the function gets expanded
  to take an extra `message` parameter, which is the message triggering
  the command. This contains a lot of useful information, and is what
  enables a lot of the other macros to work. Because of this,
  be wary of naming something else `message`.

  ## Loading and Unloading

  Loading a cog merely requires having started the client:
  ```elixir
  use Example
  ```
  If you need to remove this cog from the handler:
  ```elixir
  Cogs.unload(Example)
  ```
  Or you just want to disable a single function:
  ```elixir
  Cogs.disable(:ping)
  ```
  """
  require Logger
  alias Alchemy.Cogs.CommandHandler
  alias Alchemy.Cache


  @doc """
  Sets the client's command prefix to a specific string.

  This will only work after the client has been started
  # Example
  ```elixir
  Client.start(@token)
  Cogs.set_prefix("!!")
  ```
  """
  @spec set_prefix(String.t) :: :ok
  def set_prefix(prefix) do
    CommandHandler.set_prefix(prefix)
  end
  @doc """
  Unloads a module from the handler.

  If you just want to disable a single command, use `Cogs.disable/1`

  ## Examples
  ```elixir
  Client.start(@token)
  use Commands2
  ```
  Turns out we want to stop using `Commands2` commands in our bot, so we
  can simply unload the module:
  ```elixir
  Cogs.unload(Commands2)
  ```
  Now none of the commands defined in that module will be accessible. If
  we want to reverse that, we can merely do:
  ```elixir
  use Commands2
  ```
  and reload them back in.
  """
  @spec unload(atom) :: :ok
  def unload(module) do
    CommandHandler.unload(module)
    Logger.info "*#{inspect module}* unloaded from cogs"
  end
  @doc """
  Disables a command.

  If you want to remove a whole module from the cogs, use `Cogs.unload/1`.

  This will stop a command from being triggered. The only way to reenable the
  command is to reload the module with `use`.
  ## Examples
  ```elixir
  defmodule Example do
    use Alchemy.Cogs

    Cogs.def ping, do: Cogs.say "pong"

    Cogs.def foo, do: Cogs.say "bar"
  end
  ```
  ```elixir
  Client.start(@token)
  use Example
  Cogs.disable(:foo)
  ```
  Only `ping` will be triggerable now.
  ```elixir
  use Example
  ```
  At runtime this will add `foo` back in, given it's still in the module.

  Halts the current command until an event is received.

  The event type is an item corresponding to the events in `Alchemy.Events`,
  i.e. `on_message_edit` -> `Cogs.wait_for(:message_edit, ...)`. The `fun`
  is the function that gets called with the relevant event arguments; see
  `Alchemy.Events` for more info on what events have what arguments.

  The `:message` event is a bit special, as it will specifically wait for
  a message not triggered by a bot, in that specific channel, unlike other events,
  which trigger generically across the entire bot.

  The process will kill itself if it doesn't receive any such event
  for 20s.

  ```elixir
  Cogs.def color do
    Cogs.say "What's your favorite color?"

  Waits for a specific event satisfying a condition.

  Same as `wait_for/2`, except this takes an extra condition that needs to be
  met for the waiting to handle to trigger.

  Note that, if no message of the given type is received after 20s, the process
  will kill itself, it's possible that this will never get met, but
  no event satisfying the condition will ever arrive, essentially rendering
  the process a waste. To circumvent this, it might be smart to send
  a preemptive kill message:
  ```elixir
  self = self()
  Task.start(fn ->
    Process.sleep(20_000)
    Process.exit(self, :kill)

  to deal with potentially missing arguments, pattern matching should be used.
  So, in this case, when a 2nd argument isn't given, an error message is sent back.
